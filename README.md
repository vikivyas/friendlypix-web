# Friendly Pix Web

Friendly Pix Web is a sample app demonstrating how to build a JavaScript/Web app with the Firebase Platform.

Friendly Pix is a place where you can share photos, follow friends, comment on photos...

To see it in action, have a look at [friendly-pix.com](https://friendly-pix.com)


## Few words on technology used

The Friendly Pix frontend is built using JavaScript, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and jQuery.

Friendly Pix is written in ES2017 using Modules so for wide browser support the code is packed and transpiled to ES5 using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). 

The Auth flow is using [Firebase-UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web).

Javascript Runtime dependencies as well as Build and deploy dependecies are managed using [npm](http://npmjs.com/). 

Server-side micro-services are built on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).


## Create and configure your Firebase Project

1. Create a Firebase project using the [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console).
1. Visit the **Storage** section and enable storage by clicking the **Getting Started** button.
1. Enable **Google** as a Sign in provider in **Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign in Method** tab.
1. In a console run `firebase use --add` and, when prompted, select the Firebase Project you have just created. This will make sure the Firebase CLI is configured to use your particular project.
1. [Optional] To enable the automatic inapropriate image blurring, [Enable the Cloud Vision API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/vision.googleapis.com/overview?project=_) on your project and enable Billing.
1. [Optional] To enable IP-based geolocation filters, [Enable the Geolocation API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geolocation.googleapis.com/?project=_) and the [Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com/?project=_) on your project.
1. In a console run `npm install` to install all Build/Deploy tools dependencies.
1. [Optional] To enable email notifications for flagged content, set your Mailgun API credentials using:
    ```bash
    firebase functions:config:set mailgun.domain=friendly-pix.com mailgun.key=key-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```
## Deploy the app on firebase

On new projects, the Realtime Database and Cloud Storage come with default Security rules that prevent all read and writes. You'll need to deploy the security rules and Cloud Functions once first. For this run:

```bash
firebase deploy --only database,storage`
```

Please note that all Google Cloud Functions cannot yet be ran locally. You have to deploy them once first if you want these features active (such as image and text moderation). For this run:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Before deploying this will automatically install all runtime dependencies, transpile the Javascript code to ES5 and install Cloud Functions dependencies. For this run:

```bash
firebase deploy
```
Please don't use **--only hosting**

Then this deploys a new version of your code that will be served from `https://<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com`

## Start a local development server

**Please note that all Google Cloud Functions cannot yet be ran locally. You have to deploy them once first if you want these features active (such as image and text moderation).**

Before you start, make sure you're using the latest versions of [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or [JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To install the Firebase Emulators, use the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/) and follow the steps below.

Start the emulator using the following command. The emulator runs during all your tests. This will make sure you have all needed tools and dependecies reday before any build.
  ```bash
firebase emulators:start
```
Now that you've installed the [emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup#realtime-database), [set up tests](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/unit-tests) and [generate reports](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-reports) to validate your rules' behavior before them to production.

You can start a local development server by running:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start `firebase serve` and make sure your Javascript files are transpiled automatically to ES5.

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Admins

To make a user an admin - allowing him to delete any posts - manually add an entry to `/admins/$index/email: admin@email.com`. For instance `/admins/1/email: bob@gmail.com`.

## Mobile Apps

The [Android](https://github.com/firebase/friendlypix-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/firebase/friendlypix-ios) versions of FriendlyPix need the Cloud Functions, the Realtime Database rules and the Cloud Storage rules to be deployed to work properly. To deploy these run:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions,database,storage
```
